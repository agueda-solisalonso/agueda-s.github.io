Connections predict career success across many occupations, including academia, where conference participation builds professional networks. This paper experimentally tests whether academic affiliation influences conference acceptance. Using a matched-pair field experiment during the review phase of an early-career economics workshop, we randomly assign papers with and without author affiliations to reviewers. We find a strong bias favoring prestigious institutions, reducing diversity by lowering the representation of women and first-generation graduates. This bias is primarily driven by in-group favoritism from reviewers at similarly ranked institutions. Our findings highlight how affiliation bias reinforces inequalities and limits academic diversity.
