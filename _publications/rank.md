Using university administrative data matched with census student surveys, I estimate the effects of class rank on job preferences, labor market prospects, and early career outcomes. I find that being top of the class affects career prospects and increases academic orientation, pushing graduates to pursue further education and to postpone labor market entry. Higher-ranked students are willing to accept more precarious employment contracts in exchange for jobs that align better with their studies, suggesting a role for intrinsic motivation. Effects are stronger for males and peer groups with higher average ability, indicating that peer competition influences rank effects.
