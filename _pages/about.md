I am a Doctoral Fellow at Collegio Carlo Alberto and a PhD student at the University of Turin, where I work under the supervision of Chiara Pronzato and Maria Laura Di Tommaso. I visited the Amsterdam School of Economics in 2023/2024, hosted by Giuseppe Sorrenti. 

I am an applied economist, primarily interested in education and labor economics. My current research explores the impact of signals in higher education, such as academic distinctions or institutional prestige, on early labor market outcomes.
